Flibble- is a high-level Java API for easily creating SIP enabled VoIP applications. Suitable for either a desktop (softphone, attendant console) or server-side (call screening, auto-attendant, ACD) application. Defines a generic media provider interface, and includes an implementation of that interface which uses the Java Media Framework.

What to download:

1. flibbleCallMgr_<version>.jar - Contains the FlibbleCallMgr,
 which allows you to place and receive calls.

2. flibbleMediaPlugin_JMF_<version>.jar - If your application
 needs media support (if you plan on using the microphone,
 speakers, or for streaming .wav files), you will need this
 default media interface implementation.

3. flibble-depends.zip - These are the libraries which flibble
 depends on.  You will need these in your runtime classpath.

Examples:

The PlaceCall and ReceiveCall examples are a good place to start.

PlaceCall places an outgoing call to a (currently) hardcoded sip uri.
It reads loads 2 test .wav files from the user's home directory
( in Windows, C:\Documents and Settings\YourUsername\, and in Linux /home/YourUsername/),
and plays them out to the remote endpoint.  The PlaceCall source 
can be found in the flibblePlaceCallExample_<version>-src.zip file.

ReceiveCall registers with a SIP registrar or proxy, and waits to 
receive calls, which are automatically answered.
The ReceiveCall source can be found in the
flibbleReceiveCallExample_<version>-src.zip file.
